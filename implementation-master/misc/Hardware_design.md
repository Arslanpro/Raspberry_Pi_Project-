# Hardware
## Main display
### 8 x 32 neopixel matrix
* diffuser
    * diffuser over pixels to make the pixels look more pleasant
    * some diffused sections can be overprinted with text, e.g. to display days of the week underneath the time
* dimming function? what is the minimal possible brightness?

## Accelerometer modules
* As thin as possible
* maybe integrated in some fabric?

### Connection
* wired
    * signal integrity
    * long enough to be routed under / around bed to be less of a nuicance
    * flat cable
    * durable connector for modules

    * more complex
    * batteries
    * wifi / bluetooth

# User Interface
## alarm setting
### Rotary dial + alarm toggle
* single knob alarm time adjustment
    * flash alarm time range on main neopixel display?
    * or a secondary small screen to show alarm time + wake up range
* days of week are illuminated in different colors depending on if alarm is set
### Hardware "timer" style knobs
* 24h hour dial + 12 position minute adjustment (5 min intervals)
    * is a bed-frienly interface, no need to look at the display
